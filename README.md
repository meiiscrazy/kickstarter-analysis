### Challenge
Based on the analysis I found that Louise will have a 71% success rate of kickstarting a project if the goal is less than $1000 and if the project is categorized as 'theatre' and launched in May. Trends shows that theatre projects launched in the spring time were successful, specifically during the month of May where it had the most number of theatre projects successfully launched.
