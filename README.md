### Challenge
Based on the analysis I found that Louise will have a 71% success rate of kickstarting a project if the goal is less than $1000. Trends shows that theater projects launched in the spring time were successful, specifically during the month of May where it had the most number of theatre projects successfully launched. If Louise decides to set a project goal between $15000 - $50000 the chances of the project being successful is less than 10%. This analysis can change because I only looked for outcomes based on launch date for theater projects, it's possible that different categories have different outcomes. Additional graphs showing the outcomes for each of the different categories could help give a better analysis or update the graph to include all the categories so Louise is not limited to the 'theater' category.
